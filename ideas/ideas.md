# Ideas

yeah just ideas for the mod 

### Item, Fluid, and Energy transportation

"Transport Nodes" are the origin for different "waveforms" which will transport different things.

![Concept Art](/ideas/transport.png)

There can be many different waveforms for transporting different types of things

Square - Items
Sine - Fluids
Sawtooth - Energy

These waves can also be colored for different channels, can be filtered (with upgrades), and will make sound based on some factors.

Each wave will have a "frequency" which will determine how many items are transported a second and what the maximum distance of the wave is.

Lower frequency means items will be transported slower, but will be able to be transported over longer distances.
Higher frequency means items will be transported faster, but will not be able to be transported for long distances.

Waves will also have a decibel values which will start low but can be upgraded. This will increase the base value for distance.

Formula will be made later.

There are also "Waveform Relay" blocks that will reset the maximum distance and allow multiple waveforms to be attatched. (only one waveform can be attatched per transport node.)

### Materials

- Argencad: A natural ore that contains zinc and silver. Smelting it will only yield zinc, but later, a special machine will allow you to extract silver from the ore, leaving behind raw zinc and silver.
- Zinc: Used in some early-game machines, and can be alloyed with copper to create...
- Brass: Used in mid-game machines.
- Silver: Unknown for now.
- Polished Amethyst: A refined form of amethyst. At first made manually with water and a chisel, later machines can do it for you. Used for transport nodes, relays, and some machines.

### Machines

Primitive machines will run on energy, but will also require tones to be made nearby.
Around mid-game, machines will have built-in speakers to generate noise.

Now for a list of machines to be made!

#### Sound Smelter

By introducing noise to amethyst, and having that noise bounce between different crystals, heat is generated, smelting materials. Works as a furnace.

#### Polisher

Does not require noise to run. Does need a source of water. This machine will turn amethyst crystals into their polished form. Can also be used for some other recipes involving ore processing...

#### Crusher

Crushes things using sound. idk

#### Splitter

Takes one thing and splits it into 2. used to split argencad at forst. At later stages acts as an uncrafting table.

### Instruments

These will be mostly cosmetic and just for fun.
