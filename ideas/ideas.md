yeah just ideas for the mod 

### Item, Fluid, and Energy transportation

"Transport Nodes" are the origin for different "waveforms" which will transport different things.

There can be many different waveforms for transporting different types of things

Square - Items
Sine - Fluids
Sawtooth - Energy

These waves can also be colored for different channels, can be filtered (with upgrades), and will make sound based on some factors.

Each wave will have a "frequency" which will determine how many items are transported a second and what the maximum distance of the wave is.

Lower frequency means items will be transported slower, but will be able to be transported over longer distances.
Higher frequency means items will be transported faster, but will not be able to be transported for long distances.

Waves will also have a decibel values which will start low but can be upgraded. This will increase the base value for distance.
